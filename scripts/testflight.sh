# Archive a Release build and upload it to App Store Connect, where it lands in TestFlight.
#
# The version comes from MARKETING_VERSION in project.yml (e.g. 1.0.0). The build number is
# assigned by Xcode at upload time: it asks App Store Connect for the next one (1, 2, 3, ...),
# so nothing needs committing after an upload.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/testflight.sh              archive and upload
#   scripts/testflight.sh --no-upload  archive only
#
# Uploading uses the Apple account signed in to Xcode (Settings > Accounts). To use an
# App Store Connect API key instead (as CI does), set ASC_KEY_PATH (the .p8 file),
# ASC_KEY_ID and ASC_ISSUER_ID.
